# RNC
Remote Node Configuration

An application for configuration of remote devices such the firmwares produced by Arjan Van Vaught in his project [DMX512 / RDM / Art-Net 4 / sACN E1.31 / OSC / SMPTE / Pixel controller / RDMNet LLRP Only nodes](https://github.com/vanvught/rpidmx512).

Work-in-progress to support configurations of remote nodes using a HTTP + JSON api.

The app should work across Android/IOS mobiles, and Linux/Mac/Windows desktops.  It is based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) SDK and written in Dart.

## Status

#### Still in development


Working with latest development branch, can detect devices via mDNS and retrieve and store .txt files via the HTTP server.

Working on Linux, Android and should work on MacOS and Window, but needs to be compiled on those platforms for desktop/devices, and I don't have a iPhone etc...
